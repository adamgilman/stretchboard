### [Go straight to the live stretchboard site](http://adamgilman.com/stretchboard/)

It started at the lack of real contexual information on the scoreboards for College Football websites.

Some of the things I wanted to see from a College Football scoreboard was

* Did the team move up or down in the ranking from last week?
* Who did they play last week?
* Who will they play next week?

None of the popular College Football scoreboards did a good job at displaying this infor for me, so I decided to write my own.

For the technically minded there's actually two sides to the project

* [Data Collector](https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard)
* [Web Front End](https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard/tree/gh-pages)

The [data collector](https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard) is written in Python and is mostly contained in the [scores generator](https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard/blob/master/collector/create_score_json.py) and the [schedule generator](https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard/blob/master/collector/create_schedule.py)

The [web front end](https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard/tree/gh-pages) is a HTML powered by [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) which handles all of the loading, processing of schedules, scores and building the actualy page you see. It's an almost blank HTML page before the CoffeeScript get's going.

There's two main CoffeeScript components in the app

* [loader](https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard/blob/gh-pages/coffee/loader.coffee)
* [schedule](https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard/blob/gh-pages/coffee/schedule.coffee)

[loader](https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard/blob/gh-pages/coffee/loader.coffee) has two jobs, the primary one is to go grab all of the json files generated by the [data collector](https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard) and then signal once all the files are loaded to start the page build. The second is to declare the basic objects like a [Schedule](https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard/blob/gh-pages/coffee/loader.coffee#L83), a collection of all of the [scores](https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard/blob/gh-pages/coffee/loader.coffee#L22), and the current [rank](https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard/blob/gh-pages/coffee/loader.coffee#L1).

Once the loader is finished getting all the needed files, the [schedule builder](https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard/blob/gh-pages/coffee/schedule.coffee#L93) takes over. This goes through every ranked team in order and pulls out each game 3 weeks prior and 2 weeks foward and gathers all of the information needed to build out of the schedule page. All of the display complexity is encapsulated into either the [Game](https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard/blob/gh-pages/coffee/schedule.coffee#L28) object or the [Team](https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard/blob/gh-pages/coffee/schedule.coffee#L1) object. 

The [templating logic](https://github.com/adamgilman/stretchboard/blob/gh-pages/coffee/main.coffee#L8) is kept purposefully simply and lets the CoffeeScript data models handle most everything.
